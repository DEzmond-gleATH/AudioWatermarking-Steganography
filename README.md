# AudioWatermarking-Steganography

Audio watermarking, also known as audio steganography, is a technique that involves embedding hidden information within audio files.The primary goal of audio watermarking is to provide a means of copyright protection, authentication, or even data transmission while maintaining the original audio's quality and integrity.

Hey there!

I had the exciting opportunity to work on a project that involved using MATLAB to implement some nifty watermarking techniques. Our main goal was to safeguard and authenticate the copyrights of audio signals. It's like adding a secret signature to your favorite music!

We got creative and used the "Least Significant Bit" (LSB) method to embed these watermarks right into the audio signals. This technique is simple yet super effective. Imagine it as tucking in a tiny hidden message within the music.

One of the coolest things we did was test the strength of this watermarking approach. We wanted to see how well it held up against different challenges like cropping, noise interference, and even compression. And you know what? Our technique passed with flying colors! It showed its resilience in the face of these transformations, like a secret code that's really hard to crack.

The cherry on top? We've basically crafted a user-friendly and strong solution for copyright protection and verification in the realm of audio signal processing. It's like having a digital security guard for your tunes. So, if you ever find yourself grooving to your favorite track, just remember that there might be a hidden watermark there, keeping things safe and sound.
